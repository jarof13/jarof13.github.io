# Data Scientist

## About me

I am a Data Scientist with a solid background in quantitative methods and statistical analysis, focused on extracting knowledge from data to drive strategic decision-making. I am currently pursuing two master’s degrees at the University of Buenos Aires: Management and Data Analysis in Organizations, and Data Mining, enhancing my skills in data science, advanced analysis, and process automation.

I have experience using industry-standard tools such as Python, R, SQL, Plotly, and Power BI, applying them to develop analytical solutions, automate workflows, and create effective visualizations.

I am passionate about solving complex problems, optimizing processes, and generating value through advanced analysis techniques and clear communication of results. My goal is to transform data into strategic insights to improve efficiency and decision-making within organizations.
